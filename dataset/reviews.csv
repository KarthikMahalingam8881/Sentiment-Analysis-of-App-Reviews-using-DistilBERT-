I have started using it before I started university to help remind me of important things and it has. There were times that if the app would not have reminded me I would have had problems like doctor appointments. I have been available to stay on top of things and stay organised. This reminder app is better than any other that I have tried. I can make lists and I can also put a specific time to remind me of the thing I need a reminder of. Highly recommended you try it!!!,5,12,4.15.5.4,2019-08-12 08:26:05,We are so happy to hear you are enjoying Any.do and it's reminders :),2019-08-14 10:18:08,4.15.5.4,most_relevant,com.anydo

I'll have a daily task, like reading, that can float through my day... often times I'll get it done in the might before I go to bed, other times it'll happen in the afternoon when I have free time. I can schedule my reading task daily, but if I complete the task at 12 AM on the night of November 1st, it counts as ""tomorrow"" and won't automatically reappear until November 3rd. I propose that Todoist have a night-owl setting, in which we late-nighters can define when our days end. I don't want my reading to count for November 2 if I'm completing the task for November 1 before I've gone to sleep. I don't want Todoist to skip that task to November 3 even if it is the next calendar day because I won't have done my reading for November 2.

Over a decade ago I used Outlook Tasks constantly. The only feature where TickTick does not meet the old Outlook task is that TickTick is designed to have a single date associated with a task (called a due date). I use the Due Date as a ""start date"". TickTick is less flexible in building special reports based on both start date and end date for a task. I think of tasks always as having a start and an end. When you use the ""duration"" in the paid for version, it is still complicated as TickTick does not provide easy ways to create custom reports and smartlists using StartDate and EndDate. Other than that, this is a fantastic app that allows you to create ""lists"" of tasks (I use as ""Projects""), have a 4 level priority system which I no, low, medium and high priority but I use as ""low-medium priority"" (no !), High Priority (!), TODAY (!!) and NOW (!!!). This way I can easily signal what one to three tasks I am working on Right Now when I get disrupted with another call it is easy to redirect myself. Great app. I gladly pay for it so they can continue to support the app and improve it - and I get the value out of the app. I have looked around for better todo list apps multiple times and never found anything better short of going fully back to Outlook to manage my emails and calendar which I do not plan to do.",5,19,5.9.2.1,2021-03-22 11:28:29,,,5.9.2.1,most_relevant,com.ticktick.task

Needed something with a home screen widget and desktop version for work, and a big selling point for me is that you can hide features you don't need or have. Tired of companies trying to shove premium features down my throat. This app is very simple-faced. Also love tiny features like turning your lists into a kanban view! Couldn't do that with Wunderlist! Also love the priority color categories to sort by!",5,3,5.5.1.0,2020-03-04 13:20:02,,,5.5.1.0,most_relevant,com.ticktick.task

Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page.

However, the ""game"" part is way too complicated because there are hundreds of parts and animals and food and potions and clothing and quests, and none of it is actually explained nor is there a clear path to follow. Because of that, it was off-putting so I tried for a week and decided that the original idea and purpose of the app is what I need, but not this one. 💙",3,59,3.1.1,2021-01-20 01:07:25,,,3.1.1,most_relevant,com.habitrpg.android.habitica

It has really helped me to focus on what needs to get done in my life. A couple of suggestions on how this could be even better: 1st add a calendar function so we can look back and see when we completed a task (especially if it is repetitive task like doing laundry or washing dishes etc. to track our progress) and 2nd it would be great if it could sync with other calendars like google calendar or iCal.

I love the health and coin reward system and that keeping up with your tasks allows your character to survive and will reward you with coins which you can program as irl rewards. Only two notes: the should be a vision board feature added or life goals seperate from the normal goals. Note two: if they had offered a one time cost to subscribe for life instead of monthly or yearly payments i would buy that.,5,4,4.1.9,2023-05-07 05:55:48,Thanks so much for your review.

Once you tap the icons in the top center of Forest's main screen and enable 'Deep Focus Mode', you should then be able to grant all the required permissions needed!

I was going to eventually buy the app. I like how its a one time purchase and accessible. But they updated it so the stopwatch will stop ate 60min. Yes. That means that since I didnt know that I lost track of the rest of the time that I devoted to a task. U could have made it go over but not make the tree grow. That was shady. Now it properly warns you about the time limit. There are rumours about forest 2.. which would mean this app would prob be forgotten..,2,0,4.77.3,2024-07-12 05:08:29,"Hi,

I plant the trees for various different reasons such as studying, excersising, relaxing, etc. However, I need some apps to be available in certain activity while unavailable in others.
