# Sentiment-Analysis-of-App-Reviews-using-DistilBERT
## Overview
This project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis model to classify app reviews from the Google Play Store. Utilizing the DistilBERT model, the project aims to achieve efficient and accurate sentiment classification. The model is optimized for performance on CPU-only environments, leveraging advanced NLP techniques and the PyTorch deep learning framework.

## Features
- Data Collection: Reviews collected from multiple applications on the Google Play Store.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and tokenized text data for efficient model training.
- Model Implementation: Utilized DistilBERT for sentiment analysis, implemented with PyTorch.
- Performance Optimization: Techniques to ensure the model runs efficiently on CPU-only environments.
- Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy in sentiment classification.

## Usage
Follow these steps to use the sentiment analysis model:

- Collect Reviews: The project includes scripts to collect app reviews from the Google Play Store using the google-play-scraper library.
- Preprocess Data: Preprocess the collected reviews using the provided data cleaning and tokenization scripts.
- Train Model: Train the DistilBERT model using the preprocessed data.
- Evaluate Model: Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.
- Get Predictions: Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new reviews.
